Question

On the 23rd July 2020, the Irish Government announced an Employment Wage Subsidy
Scheme (EWSS) to help employers impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The aim of this
scheme is to provide a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers to allow them to retain as
many employees as possible. When payroll figures are submitted to Revenue, their software
will calculate how much subsidy to pay to the employer. But the employer would like to know
when processing the wages for employees how much that subsidy will be.

For the payroll user, an EWSS calculator is required to alert them if the employer will get the
subsidy for an employee based on the employee’s earnings in the payroll period.

The employer will get a subsidy for weekly paid employees if the number of insurable weeks
is between 1 and 5 and their gross pay is greater than €151.50 per week. The amount of the
subsidy is then determined by the gross pay. If an employee’s wages are less than €203 the
subsidy amount is €203. For employees earning between €203 and €300 per week the
subsidy is €250. Between €300 and €400 per week, an employee would get a subsidy of
€300. Finally, if an employee earns more than €400 per week, and up to and including €1462
per week, they will be entitled to a subsidy of €350 per week.

You have been asked to provide a system (using the C programming language) for analysing
a list of employees. The employee details will be provided as a text file. An example of an
